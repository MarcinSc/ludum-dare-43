Themes
1. Automation
- This theme automatically leads to some kind of puzzle game, where the goal is to automate some process, but that's the
obvious interpretation.

2. Break the cycle
- Bicycle riding through rough terrain?
- Enemies ride on bicycles?
- Break the seasons cycle by changing climate? Pollution?
- Cycle of life and death?

3. Control the environment, not the player
- "Lemmings" inspired game, where the goal is to get some percentage of characters to safety through the environment by
building ramps, and other contraptions. Characters go to produce resources, when they encounter a farm/mine, but each
place has a limit on how many characters can work there.

4. Each playthrough builds on the last
- Player has to go through the same level multiple times in the row, but each playthrough has persistent changes from
last run. For example all the levers that have been switched remain so, and levers can control multiple elements
(opening one door, closing another). Very challenging level design. Maybe provide level editor to allow people to create
and share their own levels (time constraints?)

5. Everything grows
- Killing enemies spills their blood on the ground. The blood energy accumulates over time (some cool shader), and when
reaches a limit, from the blood a new enemy type is born. Maybe different enemies spill different types of energies -
fire, ice, animal, earth, and from different types of energies different enemies can be spawned.
- Puzzle game, where different elements grow (change size) based on some triggers. Different elements can grow at
different speeds.

6. It only changes when you aren't looking
- "Doctor Who" inspired game with Weeping Angels. Player has a cone of vision displayed and angels are trying to reach
him (to kill). Angels are able to move only when not in player's vision. 2d top-down display of the room, with player,
angels and the target (Tardis?). Additional feature possible - mirrors that extend the field of vision, using normal
reflection world rules. Also, maybe cameras, that can be setup by player to provide additional field of vision. Maybe
angels only move, when player moves and/or turn, that will give player time to think.

7. Sacrifices must be made
- Player disembowels sacrificial animals to create items.
- Tribe, controlled by player, has to sacrifice animals/enemies to appease gods and receive blessings. If sacrifices are
not made, gods get angry and destroy player's progress/kill tribesmen.

8. Absorb your enemies
- This could be just a simple adventure game, where you can absorb enemies' energy to regain health/mana, but also maybe
something that will allow you to temporarily gain their powers, therefore absorbing their essence.

9. Darkness is your friend
- "Darkness" could be an NPC character that follows player (with some cool shader), that has some special abilities that
trigger automatically on proximity to interesting objects (torch, etc). Maybe player would be able to give some simple
commands to the NPC.
- Player has to hide in shadows to avoid detection, very obvious interpretation, but with cool GFX this can turn out to
be juicy stealth kind of game.

10. Don't trust the game
- Game full of traps. The same kind of traps may look the same, but work differently - very uncool design, unless the
traps can be avoided with reflexes, no matter what kind of trap it is. Traps could be randomly assigned function upon
level (re)start, so that when player dies, the traps might change, even though they look the same.

11. Magic, but at what cost?
- Player can execute some powerful attacks, but each attack depletes player's energy/health, which can only be recovered
by killing opponents. For balance, attacks cannot automatically hit, but failing casting or missing enemies has to be
a real possibility.
- Player can cast spells at a cost of sanity (Lovecraft)? Player can gain some quirks the lower the sanity is and might
gradually lose control of the character (move slower, jump lower, occasionally reverses controls, randomly jumps). There
should be a mechanism for regaining sanity, or just see how far the player can go with the quirks piling up.

12. Making connections
- Can be a simple connect-three kind of puzzle game, but that's very obvious and not very creative. Maybe some kind of
twist could be added to the mechanics. Has a potential for some cool GFX and shaders.

13. One item, many uses
- Point and click adventure, but requires a lot of art assets, which I can't do.
- Items available to character can have limited number of uses (more than one).

14. Take one, leave one
- Puzzle game, where player is presented with choice of two things at a time, and can choose just one to use.

15. Two connected worlds
- Platformer, where player can travel through two parallel worlds. Maybe some items that allow to look into the other
side on demand.

16. Evolve
- Through exploration and killing, player accumulates different types of energies, and based on those energies evolves
different body parts/abilities.
