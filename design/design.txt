Game title: "MOM"
Subtitle: "Sacrifices must(?) be made!"

General design:
2d platformer, player takes control of a Mom, that fights monsters made of dirty clothes, kitchen utensils, etc. to
reach the level's goal - a small child, possibly sleeping in a cot.

Ideas:
1. When player dies, a screen goes to black and voice over, or text is shown: "You've been home all day, and you did not
even clean the house?"
2. When player kills a monster, a quote is shown at the bottom of the screen.

Sample quotes (spoken when a monster is killed):
- I did not go to college for that...
- And at the end of the day he will come home and tell me how tired he is...
