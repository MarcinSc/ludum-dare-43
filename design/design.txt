Game title: "MOM"
Subtitle: "Sacrifices must(?) be made!"
Dedication: To my Mom - for all the sacrifices she has made for me.

General design:
2d platformer, player takes control of a Mom, that fights monsters made of dirty clothes, kitchen utensils, etc. to
reach the level's goal - a small child, possibly sleeping in a cot.

Unique mechanics:
The story will not carry the game alone.

Braindump:
- Maybe just make it a good fighting platformer with nice gfx - shaders etc.
- Mother with superpowers?
- Killing with broomstick? Maybe can fly on a broomstick - too strong if permanent, maybe unlockable or costs energy.
- She sweeps as she walks, and there are some mechanics associated with dust on ground. The dust builds up over time and
spawns dust bunnies.
- Is it offensive to portray moms like that? Probably not, if the overall message of the game strongly shows that it's
a sacrifice women make for their families.
- Bush died!
- Background is a wallpaper - baby blue color. Platforms have wood texture. Level is filled with common household items,
just for decoration - tables, chairs, wall clock, etc. Items that look as if they could be jumped over, must be lighter
in tone as to not to confuse player.
- What props could be available in house? Light switches? Maybe some game mechanics based on light, or electricity.
- Dust bunnies can look like Susuwatari from Spirited Away.
- Maybe mother has to make sure the child is safe?


Ideas:
1. When player dies, a screen goes to black and voice over, or text is shown: "You've been home all day, and you did not
even clean the house?"
2. When player kills a monster, a quote is shown at the bottom of the screen.

Sample quotes (spoken when a monster is killed):
- I did not go to college for that...
- And at the end of the day he will come home and tell me how tired he is...
