Sacrifices must be made

- Player disembowels sacrificial animals to create items.

Not much gameplay...

- Tribe, controlled by player, has to sacrifice animals/enemies to appease gods and receive blessings. If sacrifices are
not made, gods get angry and destroy player's progress/kill tribesmen.

Probably has to be 3d...

- Player is a god and is tasked with helping out a tribe to grow. To use God-like powers, player must use some form of
energy, that regenerates when the tribe makes sacrifices to the god.

Probably has to be 3d...
