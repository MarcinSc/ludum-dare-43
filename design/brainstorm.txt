Sacrifices must be made

- Player disembowels sacrificial animals to create items.

Not much gameplay...

- Tribe, controlled by player, has to sacrifice animals/enemies to appease gods and receive blessings. If sacrifices are
not made, gods get angry and destroy player's progress/kill tribesmen.

Probably has to be 3d...

- Player is a god and is tasked with helping out a tribe to grow. To use God-like powers, player must use some form of
energy, that regenerates when the tribe makes sacrifices to the god.

Probably has to be 3d...

- Player is playing a mom, that is raising a child, doing chores, etc. while doing so, it speaks of how she chose to
sacrifice her career for this.

Maybe instead of doing chores, she fights monsters (platformer) made of dirty clothes, kitchen utensils/food, the end
goal is reaching a child at the end of the level.

When player dies, a screen goes to black and voice over, or text is shown: "You've been at home all day, and you did not
even clean the house?"

Sample quotes (spoken when a monster is killed):
- I did not go to college for that...
- And at the end of the day he will come home and tell me how tired he is...
