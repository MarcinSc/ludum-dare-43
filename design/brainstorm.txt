Sacrifices must be made
- Player disembowels sacrificial animals to create items.

- Tribe, controlled by player, has to sacrifice animals/enemies to appease Gods and receive blessings. If sacrifices are
not made, Gods get angry and destroy player's progress/kill tribesmen.

- Player plays a God, and helps a tribe using its powers. The powers have a cost, and the currency is earned when tribe
makes sacrifices.
